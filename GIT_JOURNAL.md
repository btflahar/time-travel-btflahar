In this project, I created various import and traditional Git documents, published them to a repository, continuously updated them and commited/pushed them.
I also got experience using pull requests, branching, and resolving conflicts.
The feature that saved me the most time was the up arrow (to reuse commands) and I learned that I need to pull sometimes before pushing to avoid errors.
